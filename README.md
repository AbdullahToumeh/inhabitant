## Personal Learnings

Being the first time I have used Wordpress, it was a challenge to learn all the wordpress specific functions used for PHP. After working with them for a bit it became clear to why Wordpress is so valuable; it's well-laid out and quite easy to work with, and overall gives the client most of the control. The Wordpress documentation makes it easy to use, and the variety of built-in functions make it easy to do anything you need to. Plus this was a fun challenge to execute some more javascript functionality into it, with the reversed header on pages with hero images and the toggle-able search bar.
